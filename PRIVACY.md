Steward X Privacy Policy
Effective Date: January 8, 2026

1. Sovereign Data Handling
At Steward X, we believe "Everyone isn't same." We do not require account registration, and we do not collect, store, or sell your personal information.

2. Location & Emergency Services
To provide the Seismic Sentinel and emergency dialing features, the app detects your coordinates locally.

Reverse Geocoding: We use a third-party API (bigdatacloud.net) to identify your country code (e.g., BD for Bangladesh) based on your coordinates.

Local Processing: Your exact latitude and longitude are used only for this request and are not stored by the Steward X platform.

3. External Feeds & Telemetry
The app polls external intelligence (USGS, Ambee) to provide real-time survival data. These requests are anonymous.

4. Transparency
"Pioneer doesn't know to rest." We are committed to maintaining a "Shield" that protects you without monitoring you.
