STEWARD X 🛰️
 
 ​Sovereign Urban Resilience & Telemetry
​
 "Pioneer doesn't know to rest."'
 
​Steward X is a hardened, independent utility designed for modern pioneers who demand absolute digital sovereignty. Built on the Industrial Midnight Protocol, it provides critical environmental monitoring and telemetry while maintaining a zero-data footprint. In a world where "Everyone isn't same," Steward X is the fortress of privacy.

​🚀 Key Pillars: 
​ Industrial Midnight Protocol: A proprietary, high-contrast UI/UX architecture optimized for low-latency performance and high-stakes readability.
​ Hardened Privacy (Zero-Trackers): No Google Analytics, no Firebase, no trackers. Your data is your own.
​ Seismic Sentinel (Beta): High-precision localized seismic monitoring for real-time environmental awareness.
​ Sovereign Build: Fully Open Source (GNU GPL v2) and compiled with transparency at its core.
